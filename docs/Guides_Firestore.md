# Firebase Console

  Before being able to use the Firebase Firestore extension we need to configure a new database to work with in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/). Follow the steps below to get your first database set up.

1. On your Firebase project's dashboard, click on **Firestore Database** and then Create Database:<br>

# Platform Setup

  Firebase Firestore implementation uses both SDK (working on **Android**, **iOS** and **Web** ) and also REST API that allows it to work on any other platform. In this section we will cover the steps necessary to start using the Firebase Firestore extension in your game.
  Select your target platform below and follow the simple steps to get your project up and running:

* {page.platform_setup#Android_Setup} (once per project)
* {page.platform_setup#iOS_Setup} (once per project)
* {page.platform_setup#Web_Setup} (once per project)
* ${page.guides_authentication#REST_API_Setup}

## Advanced Configuration

  Firebase Firestore by default uses SDKs on **Android**, **iOS** and **Web** targets and uses REST API on all other exports, but you can change this behavior (i.e.: forcing REST API to be used even on SDK enabled platforms) by changing the extension options value inside extension window (2).

# REST API Setup

  This setup is necessary for syncing the Firebase console with the REST API implementation of the extension.

1. On your Firebase console, click on the **Settings** icon (next to **Project Overview** ) and then on **Project settings** .<br>

3. In your GameMaker project, open the **YYFirebaseFirestore** extension window using the asset browser. And fill in the **Project ID** information (1) also make sure you select the REST API mode (2) to make sure it works on all the available platforms.<br>
