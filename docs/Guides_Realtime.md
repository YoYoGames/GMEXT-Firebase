# Firebase Console

Before being able to use the Firebase Realtime Database extension we need to configure a new database to work with in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/). Follow the steps below to get your first database set up.

1. On your Firebase project, click on **Realtime Database** and select **Create Database** .<br>

# Platform Setup

  Firebase Realtime Database implementation uses both SDK (working on **Android**, **iOS** and **Web**) and also REST API that allows it to work on any other platform. In this section we will cover the steps necessary to start using the Firebase Realtime Database extension on your game.
  Select your target platform below and follow the simple steps to get your project up and running:

* {page.platform_setup}#Android_Setup (once per project)
* {page.platform_setup}#iOS_Setup (once per project)
* {page.platform_setup}#Web_Setup (once per project)
* ${page.guides_authentication#REST_API_Setup}

## Advanced Configuration

   ** The Firebase Realtime Database extension by default uses SDKs on **Android**, **iOS** and **Web** targets and uses REST API on all other exports, but you can change this behavior (e.g.: forcing REST API to be used even on SDK enabled platforms) by changing the extension options value (2) in the extension window.
