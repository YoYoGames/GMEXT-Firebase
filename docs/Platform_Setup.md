> To ensure safety, refrain from storing credential files within your project directory. Instead, place them in a distinct folder to prevent accidental sharing of files in public repositories. During compilation, these files will be automatically incorporated into your project folder.

9. You have now finished the main setup for all Firebase Android modules!<br>

      ![](assets/setupWebStep2.PNG)

5. Paste the struct's contents in a text editor, replace all double quotes `"` with single quotes `'` and copy the resulting text.

> [!TIP]
> The final string should look like the following:
>
>    `{apiKey: 'xxxxxxxx',authDomain: 'xxxxxxxx.firebaseapp.com',databaseURL: 'xxxxxxxx',projectId: 'xxxxxxxx',storageBucket: 'xxxxxxxx',messagingSenderId: 'xxxxxxxx',appId: 'xxxxxxxx',measurementId: 'xxxxxxxx'}`
>
> Note that some entries might be missing depending on the features you have enabled.

6. Paste the result in the **Firebase Config Struct** extension option. Note that this cannot contain any double quotes `"`.
